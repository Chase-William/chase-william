## Notable Projects:

### Tribe Logger
Tribe Logger aims to provide members with updates about tribe log information when in-game events occur. This is where native-node addons come in, as I am using my own to get bitmaps from a window on command using it's [Device Context](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/device-contexts) as a source. This is then either piped all the way up to the `TypeScript` / `JavaScript` to displayed in a canvas, or given to [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) *(building from source using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg))* inside the native `C++` addon; then the text found is routed up the caller.

In the image below you can see it capturing a bitmap from the `ARK: Survival Evolved` window and then displaying it in the `Electron` app window. The green box is the area the user can `crop` for tesseract to scan for text.

Recently I ported the project to use this [template](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) to help speed up `React` integration.

#### Remaining:
 - Finish Front-End / Packaging *using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) | [babel](https://babeljs.io/)*
 - Build a `Rest API` coupled to a `DBMS` and it's database *(client authentication needed | probs gonna go [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 8.0)*
 - Build the `Discord Bot` *(using [GoLang](https://golang.org/) & [discordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo))*

Tribe Logger is a electron app that is being build with React as it's front-end JS framework.

This repo is currently under active development and is private because of possible monetization once finished. 

### Game Of Life
This project was created for [ICS](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/ics) department and moreover the [SVP](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/svp) group of 2021. It is based off the [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and is available on:
- Console *(.NET Core)*
- Desktop *(WPF .NET Core)*
- Mobile *(Android using Xamarin)*

*note - the console also accepts input for rows/columns/cycleTime, but in the provided screenshot you cannot see it because it has been cleared away...*

I attended the event and assisted new students with building their own apps from this repo. Checkout the [repo](https://github.com/MAD-NTID/GameOfLife) if you want to see more or download it for youself.

### Lil Widgets

[Lil Widgets](https://github.com/Chase-William/LilWidgets) is a library that provides progress & loading controls to `Xamarin.Forms`. The motive behind this project was I wanted to learn more about animations and how to create them. Therefore this project depends heavily on `SkiaSharp` and its various public packages.

I created the widgets from scratch using `SkiaSharp` and a `Canvas`. I learned more about `Delta-Time` *(used it before in `Unity`)* and how to implement better animation update routines *(moving away from frame rate based update to time based)*. I never felt my own implementation was smooth enough so I ended up coupling my animation updates to the built-in [Animation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/xamarin.forms.animation?view=xamarin-forms) class *(uses native animation utilities)*.

This project's underlying structure is based off [Microcharts](https://github.com/microcharts-dotnet/Microcharts), except this repo is coupled to Xamarin.Forms as I previously mentioned.

### Baby Fingers

The app Baby Fingers uses `Xamarin.Forms` to provide both `Android` & `iOS` packages. It is available on both `Google Play` and the `Apple App Store`. The app provides various topics that have lessons within in them with quizzes to test your memory once you're ready!

The app is currently not available to the public to protect the client.
